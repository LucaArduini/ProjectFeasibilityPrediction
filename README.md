# Project Feasibility Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence
Project for the Business and Project Managment class at Pisa University - "Project Feasibility Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence"

### Summary
Our project for the Business and Project Management course aims to implement an artificial intelligence model that assists project managers in predicting project outcomes based on selected parameters during the planning phase. These parameters include budget, estimated timelines, and various others. The objective is to provide an output that indicates the predicted outcome of the project, whether it will fail, encounter issues (such as delays or cost overruns), or proceed smoothly. Additionally, we intend to include an infographic that highlights the variables that have the most significant impact on each prediction. <br>
This interactive approach will empower project managers to make data-driven decisions and optimize project planning and execution.
